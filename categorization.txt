# TODO
'''
It is definitely worth looking into splitting up the 'ale' dataset into more specific categories.
I haven't looked into the dataset enough but I assume the vast majority of beers fall under this category, 
unless we break it up or perform some model balancing I would expect it to be heavily biased towards this category.

The same could possibly be said fo for the lagers category, but I'm not sure.

If you are still stuck with an extremely low accuracy even with this tweak, I think it'd be a good idea that
we look into other features. I still believe that identifying certain keywords in the text part of the review
would work extremely well for this case.
